# water-flow

This Python project contains two files, water_flow.py and test_water_flow.py, which together form a simple calculator for various water flow parameters. The water_flow.py file contains functions to calculate the height of a water column, the pressure gain from water height, and the pressure loss from a pipe. The test_water_flow.py file contains unit tests for these functions using the pytest framework.

Usage
To use the calculator functions, simply import water_flow.py into your Python code. The test_water_flow.py file contains test cases to verify the correctness of these functions. Run the tests using the pytest command in the terminal.
